# Project Description

* For the final project, you will have a lot of leeway in deciding what you want to work on and which tools you want to use. However, remember that this is your final project and as such it should showcase what you've learned over the course and demonstrate your skills and knowledge. Act as if you will be showing off this project to a prospective employer.

* You will incorporate machine learning in the context of the technologies we have learned in the course.

* Be thoughtful and circumspect when thinking about what you want to work on. Don't hesitate to discuss it with your instructor and TAs.

* You will prepare a 10-15 minute presentatation that covers the most interesting and/or useful aspects of your project.

* You may, and are encouraged, to work in self-selected groups of 2-6. You may work alone, but recognize that you will be responsible for _all_ of the work.

* You will have about two weeks to complete this project.

* Most importantly, **be creative** and **challenge yourself**.


# Specific Requirements

* You must use SciKit-Learn and/or another machine learning library, e.g., Keras, TensorFlow.

* You must use at least two of the following:

	- pandas
	- matplotlib/seaborn
	- Flask
	- HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
	- Plotly.js
	- D3.js
	- Leaflet.js
	- MySQL
	- MongoDB
	- Google Cloud SQL
	- Amazon AWS
	- Tableau

* How you decide to present your project is up to you: Jupyter, Powerpoint, etc., but you must include a live demo of the project.


# Examples

	- Create a frontend interface that maps to an API to "smarten" the algorithm
	- Perform a deep dive of existing data using machine learning
	- Create a visualization that continues to "learn" where clusters of data are (use D3 or Plotly to change the viz)
	- Create an idea with mock data that simulates how machine learning might be used
	- Analyze existing/collected data to make a prediction, classification, or regression

* The key is to _show_ the value of what you know and can do.
